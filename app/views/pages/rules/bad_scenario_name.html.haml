  description = <<~DESC
    You should avoid words like 'test' and 'check' in your scenario name because
    this rarely describes what a user is trying to do with your system so you should
    phrase your language in those terms. The exception here is when you are being
    precise and trying to write something along the lines of 'When a patient submits
    their test sample' in which case you should disable this rule or use the 
    '@disableBadScenarioName' tag in this feature / scenario.
